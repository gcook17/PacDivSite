            <p>A native of New York City, Dr. Carol Milazzo, KP4MD, developed an interest in electronics and short wave listening while in elementary school.  She first qualified for her Second and then First Class Commercial Radiotelephone License with radar endorsement by age 14, then earned her Technician license call WB2OZA in 1970.  When she upgraded to Advanced class in 1971, she was most active on 6 and 2 meter AM, FM and HF CW.  In 1972 Carol built her first SSB rig, a Heath HW-101 and joined Air Force MARS where she participated in RTTY and traffic handling and administered license classes and exams at the Fordham Univ.

While in New York she was  a member of the Communications Club of New Rochelle, the Tu-Boro Radio Club and joined the ARRL.</p>

            <p>Upon moving to Puerto Rico in 1976, Carol exchanged her WB2 call for KP4EMN, and later the 2x2 letter call KP4MD under incentive licensing.  She continued AF MARS traffic handling and transferred to Navy MARS while serving as a Medical Officer at US Naval Hospital Roosevelt Roads.</p> 

            <p>After 1987 Carol served as a professor at the Creighton University School of Medicine and University of Nebraska Medical Center in Omaha.  While there she was active on HF PACTOR, VHF Packet and fast scan ATV as a member of the Ak-Sar-Ben Amateur Radio Club.</p>

            <p>Since 1999, Carol and her husband Roger KI6FYF have resided in the Sacramento area where she now has an established private medical practice.  Carol is active with the Samuel F. Morse ARC and the River City ARCS of which she is past-President and current Webmaster.</p>

            <p>Carol has been a member of the Medical Amateur Radio Council since 1977, an ARRL Life Member since 1973, was appointed ARRL Sacramento Valley Asst. Section Manager in 2014, elected Section Manager since 2015 and elected Young Ladies' Radio League District 6 chairwoman since 2016.</p>

            <p>Carol maintains a personal web page on <a href="http://www.qsl.net/kp4md/">www.qsl.net/kp4md</a> and is active from 80 meters through 70 cm, with special interests in homebrewing, antennas, radio propagation, and computer programming and interfacing.</p> 

            <p>Carol especially enjoys operating CW and digital modes, currently conducts VHF/UHF radio propagation studies with WSPR, and has published her work on satellite tracking, filter design and antenna modeling and analysis.  She has given several presentations at area clubs and ARRL Pacificon Conventions on antennas, portable operation, software defined radio, and WSPR, including her video documentary on the communications technology of the Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico.</p>

            <p>Carol and Roger have three adult children and three grandchildren.  When she can, Carol also enjoys playing piano and working DX holiday style from their vacation condo overlooking the north shore of Puerto Rico.</p>
