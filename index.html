            <h3>Kristen McIntyre, K6WX,is new Pacific Division Director</h3>
            <p>Kristen McIntyre, K6WX, of San Jose, California, has assumed the office
            of ARRL Pacific Division Director following the recent vacancy in the
            office. The ARRL Articles of Association stipulate she will serve as
            Director for the remainder of the current term, which expires on
            December 31, 2022. She will join the ARRL Board which is comprised of
            the organization’s 15 Directors — each representing a geographical
            area.<br>

            McIntyre was appointed as the Division’s Vice Director in 2018, and
            was unopposed as a candidate for the position in 2019. She was first
            licensed in the late 1970s while a student at Massachusetts Institute of
            Technology. She holds an Amateur Extra class license. She has served as
            ARRL Technical Coordinator for the East Bay Section, and is a member of
            the Palo Alto Amateur Radio Club. McIntyre also is licensed in Japan,
            her second home, as JI1IZZ. She is a senior software engineer at Apple.</p>

            <h3>The Mount Diablo Amateur Radio Club: Assistance to hams that lost equipment in last year’s Carr and Camp Fires </h3>
            <p>Last year’s Carr and Camp Fires brought devastation to thousands of people, including many hams. In addition to homes and other property, some hams lost their communications systems. The Club cannot help with the recovery of homes, vehicles and similar property. But, thanks to our current financial stability and the success of Pacificon, we can offer help with the recovery of ham systems and to return ham radio coverage to the affected area.</p>
            <p>The MDARC Board of Directors has established a fund to assist those that have suffered ham system loses as a result of the Carr and Camp Fires.</p>

            <h3>Pacificon</h3>
            <p><a href="http://www.pacificon.org/" target="_blank">Pacificon</a> is the ARRL Pacific Division Annual Conference.  It's the biggest event of the year in the Pacific Division!</p>
             
             <p>
                 Since the COVID-19 pandemic began in March, the Mt. Diablo Amateur Radio Club has been monitoring events, hoping that the pandemic would come under control in time for Pacificon to proceed unaltered. But it is not to be. After full consideration, we simply could not find a practical scenario that would bring all the many factors together to produce a successful Pacificon this year. The government restrictions on travel and large group gatherings, continuing level of infections occurring in the pandemic, and the increased level of risk by a substantial portion of our attendees are just a few of the factors we considered. So with considerable regret, Pacificon 2020 will not be held as an in-person event.
             </p>
             <p>
                 Although we’re very disappointed, we intend to focus our plans on making Pacificon 2021 the best ham radio convention in the western U.S. We look forward to seeing all of you in person at the San Ramon Marriott Hotel, Oct. 15-17, 2021.
             </p>
             <p>
                 All is not lost for this year, however. The Pacificon Committee is investigating the possibility of having a virtual convention, on-line. No details yet, but we hope to make some announcements next month. Please keep checking our <a target="_blank" title=" Pacificon " href="http://www.pacificon.org">web site</a>; or send us an <a href="mailto:info@pacificon.org">email</a> requesting information.
