            <img src="../images/NZ6Q.jpg" alt=" John Litz " style="float:right">
            <p><strong>Biography:</strong>  Born on Wright Patterson AFB, Dayton, Ohio to a Navy Radioman 2nd  and avid Ham, who uprooted me early with a move to California when 6 months old.  Very impressionable, he took me to work where he was part of the only communications link to Eureka during the December Floods of 1955 and  had me listen to Sputnik from his "Shack" in '57.  During a major storm in New Jersey, no power, intermittent telephone and no transistor radios in 1958, Dad built a crystal set in a plastic pill box for us to keep up with the news.  I was hooked, both on the Navy and Radio.  Since he was licensed in 1950 and I was born in 1951, you might say Ham Radio is all I know, for sure, hi hi.</p>

            <p><strong>ARRL Experience:</strong>  Family member and member off and on since 1964.  ARES member and EmComm enthusiast.  It is easy to recognize ARRL as the strongest ally of Amateur Radio.</p>

            <p><strong>Operating Experience:</strong>  My license finally came in 1965 as WN6QPV.  I spent the next 2 years gearing up and preparing to become a commercial tech.  Apprentice in a TV repair shop. Prepped for college courses, joined the School Ham Club, time just flew.  Next thing I know, I'm in Japan.  Dad is working on a big classified transmitter site for the Air Force and Stanford U.  Great gig but was not back in the country until 1970.  Work and school took my time until 1972 left me as an amputee and a struggle to be a technician.  I had to wait until the millennium to return to Amateur Radio, again as a novice, KG6ALC.  Upgrades came quickly as I was now retired.  I put more and more time into ham radio, especially EmComm and New Ham classes that gave some content to them not just the answers.  I've been Fresno County ARES EC for over 3 years, and part of RACES, Skywarn and SATERN.  My favorite thing is trying to reclaim lost time with Heathkit equipment.  I've never been a competitive contester or DXer, but I like to challenge myself continuously.  I'm a left foot cw operator but I keep improving and I think it will never go away.<br><br>
            <strong>Other Activities:</strong>  Jim, W6LK, is a family man that along with his very supportive XYL, Misa, KJ6BUE, (PACIFICON Chair,2016-2018), has three children: Emily, AI6OQ, Louis, and Mary.</p>

            <p><strong>Other Activities:</strong>  Member of the Fresno ARC and QCWA, active with regional EmComm, Trustee of WX6HNX Hanford Weather Station. Developed and improved working relationships with Red Cross, SATERN, Regional Disaster Hospital Council and CERT Organizations and Skywarn.  Certified VE, ARECC CI and CE.  A-1 OP member.  Always striving to set up a station at the end of the dirt road (camping).</p>

            <p><strong>Professional Experience:</strong>  Dan has spent most of his life in Retail Sales Management, culminating in Training and Safety Management for small Mini-Mart Chain.  Electronic saturation has been life long but through military and commercial applications in connection with his Father, Jack Pruitt K6CME (SK).  Practical knowledge, mostly HF, DC and Tube circuits.  Self taught computer basics and experimentation show in a better than average understanding.  Operationally SSB, FM, PSK, RTTY, CW, digital modes, some APRS and Packet on HF, VHF and UHF.</p>
